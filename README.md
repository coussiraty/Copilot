# Copilot
This plugin is a fork of the original copilot, [https://github.com/Curvu/Copilot ]

Credits: This project is based on Copilot, created by totalschaden, and also uses parts of the code from FollowLad.

Even though this is a fork, the code has been heavily rewritten, and the logic handling has changed. Some features from the original version have not been implemented and are not planned.

# Features
- Follow player 
- Go through portals
- Use Blink to catch up if the target gets too far away
- Close UIs (chests, crafting tables, etc.) if clicked accidentally
- Auto respawn (will attempt to respawn but can't if someone else is on the map)
- Auto Potion (New! The bot now uses potions automatically.)
- Auto skils (In progress)



# Settings
The default settings were made to fit my needs and may not work for you.
Please, do not open an issue if the plugin does not work for you due to settings.

#Tips
DO NOT use checkpoints
When the target goes through a portal, they should wait nearby so that the bot can detect them once the map loads
If you're moving too fast and the bot is not keeping up, it's your fault, not the plugin's
I recommend using the WheresMyZoomAt plugin to improve visibility
It's best to keep the Waypoint and Map Device close to each other
# Known Bugs
Might bug in ARENA
